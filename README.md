Marital Status: Married, single, or divorced

Education: Primary, secondary, tertiary, or unknown

Default: Credit in default (Yes/No)

Balance: Average yearly balance in euros

Housing Loan: Whether the customer has a housing loan (Yes/No)

Contact Type: Communication type used in the campaign (Telephone/Cellular)

Last Contact Duration: Duration of last call (in seconds)

Number of Contacts: Total interactions with the customer in the campaign

Previous Campaign Outcome: Whether the customer subscribed in the last campaign (Success/Failure/Unknown)
